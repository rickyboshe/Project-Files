<h1>Academic performance üéì vs Public perception</h1>
</center>
<p>This project looks into the academic performance of high schools in New York (2011) with additional demographic and socio-economic indicators. As i explore how performance was influenced with such indicators, i will also include a survey on the perceptions of students, teachers and parents on the quality of New York City schools.</p>
<p>I used data visualization to explore:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the relationship between demography and school performance in NYC? <strong>Goal:</strong> Observe any differences in academic performance across NYC schools‚Äô demographics.</li>
<li>What is the relationship between perceptions on academic performance and surrounding factors such as demographics and success metrics of schools? <strong>Goal:</strong> Observe how perceptions vary across demographics and if these perceptions match actual school performances.</li>
<li>Are there any similarities to how survey respondents perceive the quality of NYC schools? <strong>Goal:</strong> Observe any elements of echo chambers of opinions within groups and across groups</li>
</ol>
<p>The survey data can be found <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8">here</a> while the performance and demographics data can be found <a href="https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-schools-data/workspace/file?filename=combined.csv">here</a>.</p>

spced&lt;-read_tsv(&quot;data/masterfile11_d75_final.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Both gened dataframe (General education schools) and spced dataframe (Special education schools), have a key (dbn) that can be matched to the combined dataframe (performance and demographics).</p>
<p>Special attention to rename ‚Äúdbn‚Äù to ‚ÄúDBN‚Äù so they can match. Also note that some variables such as ‚Äúprincipal‚Äù, are not useful to this analysis. We shall drop such columns. Read the dataset dictionary for more information</p>
<p>The survey data is also granular, we would like to obtain aggregate perceptions of respondents for the schools in question.</p>
<p>The factors that respondents were surveyed on were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety and Respect</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Academic Expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>The surveyed groups were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents</li>
<li>Teachers</li>
<li>Students</li>
<li>Total (The average of parent, teacher, and student scores)</li>

<p>Using right_join() helps keep all the survey data that corresponds to matching demographic and school performance data.</p>
<p>We analyze how perception relates to demographic and school performance via a correlation matrix. <br></br></p>

<p>Overall, school performance in New York City is indeed split along the demographic backgrounds and socio-economic lines. <br><br></p>

<p>Schools with a higher proportion of Black and Hispanic have lower SAT scores as compared to schools with a higher share of White and Asian students.This could be due to the location, programs and resources at the disposal of schools.</p>
<p>Schools in boroughs like Staten Island and Manhattan would have more resources and have a higher proportion of White and Asian students as compared to schools in Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The most significant observation is how drastically school performance drops with increase in number of students eligible for lunch discount at a school. This is an indication of a school being in a socially and economically disadvantaged location. Such schools rarely have enough resources to help students perform better academically.</p>
<p>An increase in the share of students learning to speak English is also related to lower academic performance for the school. Learning to speak English can be an indicator of share of students with a lower economic migrant background. <br><br></p>

<p>Creating an arbitrary cut-off of 30%, i looked into the share of schools in each borough with at least a third of its students eligible or participating in the special programs. Again, Staten Island had the fewest schools with students taking up special programs while the Bronx had the most. This matches with the socio-economic profiles of the respective boroughs.</p>
<p>This gap also translates to average SAT scores as shown in an earlier chart between the boroughs.</p>

<p>A correlation analysis shows how strong the relationships between racial diversity and school programs are with the academic performance of the school.</p>
<p>When it comes to demographics, academic performance shows a strong positive correlation with the percentage of white students in a school (r= 0.65). While it has the strongest negative relationship with the percentage of students that are eligible for food discount at a school (r= -0.72).</p>

<p><br><br> Overall, parents seem to rate NYC schools the highest while students (not surprisingly üòÑ) are rating the schools lowest. Teachers show the most broad rating of NYC schools.</p>
<p>Ratings on school performance across the four benchmarks are really close for each respondent. 50% of the parents, for example, rate schools between 7.47 and 8.20, a difference of just 0.72. This is an indication of how similar the perceptions of individual groups are amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Looking on how individual groups responded, the best rating was for <strong>safety and respect</strong> by parent respondents and the lowest was for <strong>communication</strong> by student respondents.</p>
<p>Interesting to note that across each borough, the responses to the survey were somewhat similar. The box plot below shows how even the worst academically performing borough (Bronx) has half the respondents rating schools at a score of 7.17 while Staten Island, which is better off academically and economically has half the respondents scoring their schools at 7.30 rating.</p>

<p>This proves what we saw in the correlation matrix, that how respondents rated schools do not have a strong correlation nor a statistically significant one with actual school performance. But how respondents rated schools do closely correlate to each other.</p>
<p>This could mean there is a perception bubble among teachers, students and parents. Sadly, it does not match reality. Actual school performance is not influencing how parents, students, and teachers actually perceive the quality of schools in their neighborhoods. Rather, it seems school quality rating is similar within the individual groups, an information bubble of parents, students, and teachers, individually.</p>
<p>Perceptions are a funny thing.</p>
