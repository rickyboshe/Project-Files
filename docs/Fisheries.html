<p>As more people are opting against red meat diet for plant based and sea food, this might be a good time to analyze aquatic food sources.

<p>Utilizing visualization, this project explores:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sustainability of seafood. <strong>Goal:</strong> Exploring how sustainable the fishing rates are across the fishing regions in USA. Environmentally and Fish populations.</li>
<li>Nutritional value of seafood. <strong>Goal:</strong> Establishing the nutritional value of fish species found across US marine. Compare species, identify trends and comparison with other food sources e.g.¬†beef.</li>
</ol>
<p>This project primarily analyzes the fisheries management dataset from the <a href="https://www.fishwatch.gov/resources">National Oceanic and Atmostpheric Administration (NOAA)</a>. Accessing the latest data using their <strong>FishWatch API</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all species have their environmental effects recorded. Oysters, Mussels, Clams and Geoducks have been quoted to have a ‚Äú<strong>net benefit</strong> on the environment as they remove excess nutrients and improve water quality‚Äù. Sugar kelp have the same benefits with the additional carbon fixing where they turn carbon-dioxide into oxygen.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Salmon and Sablefish are being actively monitored by the federal and state authorities to ensure their fishing have minimal impact on the environment.</p>

<p><br></br> The most species are found in the Greater Atlantic area while the least are found in the Pacific Island fishery region.</p>
<p>This means chances are, most of the fish people consume in the US comes from the Greater Atlantic area! But does this mean the region is subject to over fishing?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/news/news-items/beef,-lamb,-lobster-or-fish-fisheries-study-shows-impact-of-food-choice-on-carbon-emissions#:~:text=lobster%20or%20fish%3F-,Fisheries%20study%20shows%20impact%20of%20food%20choice%20on%20carbon%20emissions,alternatives%20like%20beef%20or%20lamb.">research</a> from Canadian scientists, seafood has one of the lowest carbon footprint as compared to other food sources. It is estimated that in the US, each kilo of fish resulted in 1.6 kilos of carbon. Meanwhile, the environmental cost of red meat such as beef and lamb, which is estimated to range from 50 kilos to as much as 750 kilos of carbon per kilo of meat.</p>

<p><br></br> Seafood is inherently more environmentally friendly as compared to red meat. Its fishing levels, according to NOAA in the US, are well within recommended levels allowing fish populations to sustainably thrive.</p>

<p>It looks like most fish species are rich in protein, selenium and cholesterol. With the exception of Atlantic Bigeye Tuna and Pacific Blue Marin, all fish species have nutrients that are within the recommended dietary allowance in the USA.</p>
<p>All species show very low amounts of sugars, fat and saturated fatty acids, which is good for heart health. For anyone looking for a low carb diet, fish is the answer. They have very low carbohydrate per serving.</p>

<p>It would appear that the calories of fish have weak negative relationship with the amount of carbohydrates and sugars. While there is no significant relationship between fish calories with dietary fibers, cholesterol and selenium. But there is a strong relationship between fish calories and fat (r = 0.91), saturated fat (r = 0.90) and protein (r = 0.39).</p>
<p>So for people trying to avoid fat and saturated fatty acids, fish might not be the ideal dish for you. But for protein loading gym enthusiasts? seafood is a good snack.</p>

<p>Above graphs depict a <strong>nutritional value quadrant</strong> for the fish species found within the NOAA region. For all intents and purposes, the species found in <strong>quadrant 1</strong> in each graph have the best value for calories and their respective nutritional component.</p>
<p>As human diet differ across communities, some might be looking for different levels of nutrients. It is important to be aware of how calories relate to your diet of choice. Also to debunk any misguided information one might have had prior.</p>

<p>The goal is to have comparable values. I selected fruits and vegetables with the highest calories. This will be the same with the fish species selected.</p>

<p>From the two visualization, the following observations are seen:</p>
<p><strong>Fruits:</strong> They are a great source for sugars, dietary fiber and carbohydrates. Plant based produce has always been rich in starch and complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetables:</strong> They rank high in dietary fiber and carbohydrates. Like fruits, they have very little fat and protein while also registering the least amount of calories.</p>
<p><strong>Red Meat:</strong> Beef has high amounts of protein and substantial fat. Similar to pork and poultry. red meat also has the most calories of the food groups analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Seafood:</strong> Has similar amount of carbs to red meat but with less calories. Same with dietary fiber and sugars. So if you are looking to cut your calorie intake but maintain levels of carbs, fiber and sugars, seafood is a great alternative to red meat. Seafood also has less fat compared to red meat while showing similar or slightly more protein levels. Lower calories, less fat and similar protein levels? Seafood is a <strong>great</strong> alternative to red meat, nutritionally!</p>

<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>Seafood in the USA is not facing dangers of over-fishing allowing for sustainable fish populations to thrive. Seafood has significantly lower levels of carbon footprint as compared to livestock keeping and crop producing. <strong>Environmentally</strong>, a seafood diet helps the planet more than a red meat diet.</p>
<p>At the same time, seafood is showing similar or better nutritional values for protein, dietary fiber and sugars with less fat and calories. Anyone looking to maintain these nutritional values will do much better consuming seafood diet than red meat.</p>
